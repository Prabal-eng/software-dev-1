# Advanced Temperature Converter

## Overview

The **Advanced Temperature Converter** is a desktop application built with Python's Tkinter library. It allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin with a user-friendly graphical interface. 

This project demonstrates proficiency with GUI development in Python, handling user inputs, and performing conditional operations based on user choices. Additionally, it includes data validation and a history feature to review past conversions.

## Features

- **Temperature Conversion**: Supports conversions between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
- **Clear Interface**: The GUI is designed for ease of use, with clear input fields and dropdowns for unit selection.
- **Conversion History**: Records and displays a log of recent conversions.
- **Error Handling**: Provides feedback for invalid inputs, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## What I Learned

Working on this project helped reinforce several key skills:
- **GUI Development with Tkinter**: Implemented a structured, interactive user interface, using widgets like labels, entry fields, combo boxes, and buttons.
- **Styling with ttk**: Used the `ttk.Style()` theme to improve the interface aesthetics.
- **Event Handling**: Created responsive functions triggered by button clicks to handle conversions and clearing actions.
- **Input Validation**: Applied error handling to manage invalid inputs and provide feedback via `messagebox`.
- **Temperature Conversion Logic**: Built conversion formulas and conditions for different units, which expanded my understanding of basic mathematical operations in Python.
- **Data Management**: Developed a history log to track previous conversions, using a scrollable Text widget to enhance the app's functionality.

## Installation

1. **Requirements**:
   - Python 3.x
   - Tkinter (usually pre-installed with Python)
   
2. **Installation**:
   - Clone this repository:  
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```
   - Run the `temperature_converter.py` script:
     ```bash
     python temperature_converter.py
     ```

## Usage

1. Enter the temperature in the input field.
2. Select the units to convert from and to.
3. Click **Convert** to see the result.
4. The conversion result and history of conversions will be displayed in the history panel.
5. Use **Clear** to reset all fields.

## Example Conversion

- **Input**: 32 Fahrenheit to Celsius  
- **Output**: 32.00 Fahrenheit = 0.00 Celsius  
- **History**: Shows recent conversions in a scrollable log.

## Future Improvements

- Add more units (e.g., Rankine).
- Enable dark mode for better accessibility.
- Provide more comprehensive error handling for various edge cases.
